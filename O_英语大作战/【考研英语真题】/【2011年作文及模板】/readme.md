`第一篇是写推荐信 ：优秀范文赏析`

```
Der jane:
  
    i'm so glad to hear from you as it has been a long time since we met last time.
    You told me in your letter that you loved to watch insprational movies,
    so i'm writing to recommend one of my favoite movies to you,
    which is called The Devil Wears Rrada.
    
    i love it for two reasons .
    To begin with ,the film explores the theme of growth and self discovery in the workplace,
    which could easily strike a chord with young people.
    The aspirant heroine undergoes an 'ugly duckling - swan' phase in the workplace and finally
    returns to her initial ideal, inspiring us to be true to ourselves.
    
    In addition  , the grammour of fashion industry also adds appeal to the film 
    
    Hope you enjoy the moive and look forward to your reply
    
                                                                   
                                                                      Yours truly
                                                                         Li  Ming
